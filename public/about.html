<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Tyler Wright. I have been working in IT for around five years and am Security+ and Network+ certified. 
  I plan to get my CASP+ in the coming months. My skills include IT security, networking, and programming. I 
  have learned core Java, Common Lisp, and am currently enrolled in some web development courses. I hope to use
  my accumulated skills to start my own business working with web applications.

  Outside of work I spend time with my wife and two kids. Whatever time is left over I spend training in 
  Olympic weightlifting, fishing, and playing video games.
